Through the self-administered challenges, you'll apply your knowledge, build practical solutions, and acquire a deeper understanding of implementing AI solutions using Azure OpenAI.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Understand GenAI concepts and how they can be used to build chat applications.
- Learn how to configure the Azure OpenAI service and use Azure AI Search to build private OpenAI with your own data.
- Gain practical experience in implementing a chat app architecture with Terraform.
- Explore features of chat apps, such as multilingual queries and advanced chat response settings.
- Apply GenAI to real-world scenarios, including increased user interactions and dynamic document processing.
- Operationalize AI-enabled applications with enterprise-level monitoring and logging.
- Scale AI-enabled applications with enterprise-level load balancing.


## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure Open AI tools.
- Collaborating with peers to refine and implement your solutions.

## Challenges Overview

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Deploy the Azure OpenAI Service and implement the deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) within the OpenAI Service.
     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure**
   - Deploy NVIDIA NIM to Azure ML as a managed online endpoint, leveraging its containerized microservices to accelerate AI inference on NVIDIA GPUs with optimal performance and built-in security features.
          
4. **Challenge 04: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Deploy the chatapp solution architecture in Azure using Azure Bicep.
   - Navigate and explore the web app, interact adeptly with the Chat App using insightful questions, showcase multilingual query proficiency, and implement advanced settings for comprehensive Azure OpenAI service understanding.
            
6. **Challenge 05: Serverless Document Batch Processing**
   - Embrace the power of serverless computing for batch-processing documents. Analyze documents using Azure Document Intelligence Services and process them with OpenAI. 
     
7. **Challenge 06: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI Using API Management Service**
   - Operationalize your solution by setting up monitoring and logging. Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and APIM to gain insights and maintain the robustness of your AI services.


Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.

Happy hacking!

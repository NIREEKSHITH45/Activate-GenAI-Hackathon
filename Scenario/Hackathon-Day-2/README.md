## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.

     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure**
   - Deploy NVIDIA NIM to Azure to harness powerful, scalable generative AI model hosting. This guide walks you through setting up NVIDIA NIM—a suite of optimized microservices specifically designed for deploying and managing generative AI models on NVIDIA GPUs. Using Azure and NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud), you will deploy models like meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct with streamlined configuration, security, and performance features. By leveraging the NIM containerization on Azure, you'll establish an efficient and secure environment for real-time AI inference that is suitable for complex generative AI applications.
            
4. **Challenge 04: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Utilize Terraform to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
                         
5. **Challenge 05: Serverless Document Batch Processing**
   - Embrace the power of serverless computing for batch-processing documents. Analyze documents using Azure Document Intelligence Services and process them with OpenAI. 
     
6. **Challenge 06: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI Using API Management Service**
   - Operationalize your solution by setting up monitoring and logging. Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and APIM to gain insights and maintain the robustness of your AI services.


Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.

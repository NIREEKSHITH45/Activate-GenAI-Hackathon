## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.
     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This prepares the groundwork for document-based questioning essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.
             
3. **Challenge 03: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Utilize Terraform to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
          
4. **Challenge 04: Interact with Chat App**
   - Explore the deployed web app, engaging with the Chat App through well-constructed inquiries. Display your ability to handle multilingual queries and make use of advanced settings to deepen your understanding of the Azure OpenAI service's capabilities.

# Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure

### Estimated Time: 120 minutes

## Introduction

This lab guides participants through deploying NVIDIA NeMo Inference Manager (NIM) on Azure, which facilitates rapid development and deployment of sophisticated AI models for various applications. NVIDIA NIM is a model deployment and management solution that enables efficient utilization of NVIDIA GPUs for AI model inference. This deployment involves using Azure's powerful cloud infrastructure to host NIM containers, which simplifies the integration of AI models into production environments by managing model lifecycle, deployment, and scaling in Azure Machine Learning (AML) services.

Participants will begin by creating an NVIDIA account to generate an API key, essential for accessing NVIDIA’s NGC resources, such as container images for NeMo models. Then, the lab covers setting up Azure Container Registry (ACR) for storing these images, configuring Git Bash to interact with Azure, and updating relevant configuration files within Visual Studio Code. After this setup, participants will deploy the NIM container through Azure Machine Learning, which will handle the GPU-based model deployment and expose it through a managed online endpoint.

## Solution Guide

## Task 1: Generate NGC API KEY

> **Note:** This process of getting the NGC API key is no longer recommended. The participant is recommended to get the API key through build.nvidia.com as mentioned on the Scenario page.

The NVIDIA API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to NVIDIA's APIs, such as the NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud) services. This key allows developers to access various resources, including pre-trained models, GPU-accelerated software, and container images. Obtaining an API key typically involves creating an account on NVIDIA's developer portal and generating the key within the account settings. It is important to keep this key secure, as it grants access to your NVIDIA resources and can be used for billing purposes.

   ![](../../Coach/media/u1.png)

###  Task 7: Store NGC API Key for Use in the AzureML Deployment

1. To Store NGC API Key for Use in the AzureML Deployment.You have two options for storing the NGC API Key:

   >**Note :** The NGC API Key needs to be stored within Azure so the AzureML workspace can access it during deployment. The API key is required to pull the correct model from the NGC model  catalog. The key can be provided as a workspace connection to the AzureML workspace.
   
   **Store the Key as a Workspace Connection:**
   Store the NGC API Key as a custom credential using a workspace connection.

   This script stores the NGC API Key as a workspace connection credential and verifies if the provided workspace can access it.

   Run the following script to configure this and verify the connection

   ```cmd
    ./2_provide_ngc_connection.sh
   ```

###  Task 8: Save NIM Container in Your Container Registry

Pull the NIM Docker container for the model specified in the `config.sh` file.

All required commands are provided in the `3_save_nim_container.sh` script.

1. Run the following command to **save the NIM container in your container registry**.

   ```cmd
   ./3_save_nim_container.sh
   ```
   >**Note:** This action will approximately take around 20-25 Minutes.
   
   >**Note:** Ensure that the docker engine is running.

1. Navigate to your container registry (**amlregistry**) , Under the service click on the Respositiories select your **nim-meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct** regiestry, here you will find your image is pushed with the tag name **latest**.

   ![](../../Coach/media/bash2.png)

###  Task 9: Create Managed Online Endpoint

1. Run the following command to **create a managed online endpoint**.

   ```cmd
   ./4_create_endpoint.sh
   ```

   >**Note :** This command creates an endpoint with the name provided in the config.sh file.
   > **Note :** If you see an `ERROR: 'ml' is misspelled or not recognized by the system.` Run the below commands to remove, install and verify ml extension.

   ```
   az extension remove -n ml
   ```

   ```
   az extension add -n ml
   ```

   ```
   az ml -h
   ```

   >**Note :** Rerun the command to create endpoint.

###  Task 10: Role Assignment

1. Go to **amlregistry** container regiestry first. navigate to **Access control (IAM)** (1). Click on **+ Add**(2) and choose **Add role assignment** (3).

### Estimated Time: 90 minutes

## Introduction

Explore monitoring data collection, including activity logs and platform metrics. Configure Azure Monitor for log generation, customize data routing with diagnostic settings and initiate resource log collection. Discover Log Analytics Workspace limitations in logging user requests and model responses. Mitigate this by integrating the Azure API Management Service for comprehensive logging in the Azure OpenAI environment.

# Solution Guide

## Task 1: Monitoring the Azure OpenAI Service

When your crucial applications and business processes depend on Azure resources, it's essential to monitor their availability, performance, and operation. Azure OpenAI provides out-of-box dashboards for each of your Azure OpenAI resources. To access the monitoring dashboards, navigate to azure portal search and select the OpenAI and select one the OpenAI resource. On the overview Azure OpenAI resources you get  monitoring dashboards by clicking on **Monitor** tab.

   ![](../media/dashboard.png)

The dashboards are grouped into four categories: HTTP Requests, Tokens-Based Usage, PTU Utilization, and Fine-tuning.
- **HTTP Requests:** Dashboards that monitor OpenAI-powered services in Azure, displaying request volume, response times, errors, geographical distribution, and other metrics. They aid in understanding user interactions, pinpointing performance issues, and ensuring service reliability.
- **Tokens-Based Usage:** This category likely includes dashboards monitoring token usage in Azure OpenAI. Tokens are vital for authentication, authorization, and access control. They offer insights into creation rates, usage patterns, and lifetimes, and detect suspicious activities. Monitoring tokens is critical for AI resource security.
- **PTU Utilization:** PTU refers to Performance Tuning Units in Azure OpenAI. These dashboards monitor and optimize PTU use, showing allocation, trends, and efficiency metrics, and offering optimization suggestions. It's crucial for boosting performance and resource allocation.
- **Fine-tuning:** This category involves dashboards offering tools and insights for fine-tuning Azure OpenAI services. They include performance metrics, configurations, experiment results, and AI model optimization on Azure. They empower informed decisions for better AI performance and accuracy.

### Task 1.1: Configure Diagnostic Settings

Azure OpenAI collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources. You can configure Azure Monitor to generate data in activity logs, resource logs, virtual machine logs, and platform metrics. Platform metrics and the Azure Monitor activity log are collected and stored automatically, which can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting. Azure Monitor resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and a Log Analytics workspace.

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Azure OpenAI (1)**, and then select **Azure OpenAI (2)** under services.

    ![](../media/solt1s1.png)

1. On **Azure AI Services | Azure OpenAI** blade, select **OpenAI Service** deployed previously.

   ![](../media/solt2s2.png)

1. From the Azure OpenAI resource page, under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings (1)** on the left pane. On the Diagnostic settings page, select **Add diagnostic setting (2)**.

   ![](../media/4-2.png)

1. To create a new Diagnostic Settings, on the **Diagnostic Settings** page, configure the following fields:
   
   - **Diagnostic settings name:** **OpenAI Diagnostic Setting (1)**
   - Select **Send to Log Analytics workspace (2)** - To be checked.
   - **Subscription**: Default - Pre-assigned subscription **(3)**
   - **Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the only pre-created log analytics workspace available in the subscription **(4)**.
   - Under **Logs** - Select **allLogs (5)**.
   - Under **Metrics**, select **allMetrics (6)**.
   - To save the configuration, click on **Save (7)**.


   ![](../media/Active-image225.png)

   > After the successful configuration of the diagnostic settings, you can work with metrics and log data for your Azure OpenAI resource in your Log Analytics workspace.

### Task 1.2: Use the Chat Playground to ingest additional logs

The *Chat* playground provides a chatbot interface for GPT 3.5 and higher models. It uses the *ChatCompletions* API rather than the older *Completions* API.

1. Navigate back to the Azure OpenAI service that was previously created.

1. In the Azure OpenAI resource pane, click on **Explore Azure AI Foundary portal**; it will navigate to **Azure AI Studio**.

1. Click on **Chat** under the **Playgrounds** tab in the left pane.

    ![](../media/aigen9.png)
   
1. In the **Playground** section, select the **Show setup** page, and ensure that the **text-turbo (1)** deployment is selected in the configuration pane. In the **Give the model instructions and context (2)** section, replace the current text with the following statement: `The system is an AI teacher that helps people learn about AI`. Click on **Apply changes (3)**.

   ![](../media/aigen10.png)

   ![](../media/aigen5.png)
   
1. Enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:
   
   - **User**: `What are different types of artificial intelligence?` **(1)**
          
   - **Assistant**: `There are three main types of artificial intelligence: Narrow or Weak AI (such as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, image recognition software, and spam filters), General or Strong AI (AI designed to be as intelligent as a human being. This type of AI does not currently exist and is purely theoretical), and Artificial Superintelligence (AI that is more intelligent than any human being and can perform tasks that are beyond human comprehension. This type of AI is also purely theoretical and has not yet been developed).`  **(2)**
          
   - Click on **Apply changes (3)** to start a new session and set the behavioral context of the chat system.

   ![](../media/aigen8.png)

    > **Note**: Few-shot examples are used to provide the model with examples of the types of responses that are expected. The model will attempt to reflect the tone and style of the examples in its own responses.
             
   > **Note**: Click on **Continue** when prompted with **Update system message?**.

   ![](../media/Active-image230.png)
          
1. Within the query box of the chat session pane, enter the text `What is artificial intelligence?`
   
1. Use the **Send** button to submit the message and view the response.

      > **Note**: You may receive a response that the API deployment is not yet ready. If so, wait for a few minutes and try again.

      > Any text that you enter in the **Completions playground** or the **Chat Completions playground** generates metrics and log data for your Azure OpenAI resource. In the Log Analytics workspace for your resource, you can query the monitoring data by using the Kusto query language.

### Task 1.3: Analyze logs using Kusto Queries

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables, where each table has its own set of unique properties. The activity log is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view this log independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs. In the Azure portal, you can use the activity log in Azure Monitor Logs to run complex queries with Log Analytics.

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Azure OpenAI (1)**, and then select **Azure OpenAI (2)** under services.

    ![](../media/solt1s1.png)

1. On **Azure AI Services | Azure OpenAI** blade, select **OpenAI Service** deployed previously.
   
1. From your Azure OpenAI resource page, under **Monitoring** on the left pane, select **Logs (1)**, and then click on the pre-created Log Analytics workspace **(2)** that was used to configure diagnostics for your Azure OpenAI resource.

    ![](../media/Active-image231.png)

1. Within the **Log Analytics workspace** page, under Overview on the left pane, select **Logs**.

   ![](../media/4-5.png)

   > The Azure portal displays a Queries window with sample queries and suggestions by default. You can close this window.

1. For the following examples, enter the Kusto query into the edit region at the top of the Query window, and then select Run. The query results are displayed below the query text.

    - This Kusto query is useful for an initial analysis of Azure Diagnostics (AzureDiagnostics) data about your resource:
      
         - This query returns a sample of 100 entries and displays a subset of the available columns of data in the logs.
      
        ```kusto
       AzureDiagnostics
       | take 100
       | project TimeGenerated, _ResourceId, Category, OperationName
        ```

1. In the query results, you can select the arrow next to the table name to view all available columns and associated data types.

   ![](../media/Active-image232.png)

1. To see all available columns of data, you can remove the scoping parameters line `| project ...` from the query:

   ```kusto
   AzureDiagnostics
   | take 100
   ```
   > **Note:** If the logs don't reflect immediately, please wait for 10–15 minutes for them to come up.

1. You can also expand the results and check for the details provided under each for more information.

### Task 2.3: Analyze OpenAI logs using Kusto Queries within the API Management Service

> **DISCLAIMER:** Please note that it might take an hour or two for the Log Analytics Workspace to display results after a query. To ensure smooth execution and to save time, we've included screenshots of the results for better clarity and understanding. 

1. Once OpenAI requests begin to log to the Azure Monitor service, you can begin to analyze the service usage using Log Analytics queries.

2. Navigate back to the API Management Service and click on **Logs** under the **Monitoring** section.

   ![](../media/apim-logs.png)

3. Within the **New Query 1** tab, draft a new query such that:
    - The table should be named **ApiManagementGatewayLogs**.
    - The **BackendResponseBody** field contains the JSON response from the OpenAI service, which includes the text completion as well as the token and model information.
    - Paste the below query within the query editor to identify token usage by IP model:
    ```
    ApiManagementGatewayLogs
    | where tolower(OperationId) in ('completions_create','chatcompletions_create')
    | where ResponseCode  == '200'
    | extend modelkey = substring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'], 0, indexof(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'], 
    '-', 0, -1, 2))
    | extend model = tostring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'])
    | extend prompttokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['prompt_tokens']
    | extend completiontokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['completion_tokens']
    | extend totaltokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['total_tokens']
    | extend ip = CallerIpAddress
    | where model !=  ''
    | summarize
        sum(todecimal(prompttokens)),
        sum(todecimal(completiontokens)),
        sum(todecimal(totaltokens)),
        avg(todecimal(totaltokens))
        by ip, model
    ```

   ![](../media/apim-query.png)

4. Click on **Run** and notice the result, which defines the token usage based on the given prompt and response.

   ![](../media/apim-result.png)

5. Let's run another query to monitor prompt completions.
    - Replace the contents of the query editor with the following KQL to log the prompts **(1)**.
      
    ```
    ApiManagementGatewayLogs
    | where tolower(OperationId) in ('completions_create','chatcompletions_create')
    | where ResponseCode  == '200'
    | extend model = tostring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'])
    | extend prompttokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['prompt_tokens']
    | extend prompttext = substring(parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['choices'])[0], 0, 100)
    ```
    - Click on **Run (2)**.
    - Observe the intricacies of the generated result under the **Results** tab **(3)**.

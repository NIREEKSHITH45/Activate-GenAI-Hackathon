# Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search

### Estimated Time: 120 minutes

## Introduction:

All organizations rely on information to make decisions, answer questions, and function efficiently. The problem for most organizations is not a lack of information but the challenge of finding and  extracting the information from the massive set of documents, databases, and other sources in which the information is stored.

For example, suppose *Margie's Travel* is a travel agency that specializes in organizing trips to cities around the world. Over time, the company has amassed a huge amount of information in documents such as brochures as well as reviews of hotels submitted by customers. This data is a valuable source of insights for travel agents and customers as they plan trips, but the sheer volume of data can make it difficult to find relevant information to answer a specific customer question.

To address this challenge, Margie's Travel can use Azure AI Search to implement a solution in which the documents are indexed and enriched by using AI skills to make them easier to search.

      - Select **Submit (5)** to create the data source, skillset, index, and indexer. The indexer is run automatically and runs the indexing pipeline, which:
          
          1. Extracts the document metadata fields and content from the data source.
          2. Runs the skillset of cognitive skills to generate additional enriched fields.
          3. Maps the extracted fields to the index.
      
          ![](../media/Active-image65.png)  

1. On **Azure AI Search** resource page, expand **Search management (1)** select **Indexers (2)** which should show the newly created **margies-indexer (3)**.

   ![](../media/Active-image66.png)  

1. Select **margies-indexer** . Wait a few minutes, and click **&orarr; Refresh** until the **Status** indicates success.

    ![](../media/Active-image67.png) 

#### Task 5.2: Search the index

In this task, you'll learn to search and query the index created earlier:

1. At the top of the **Overview** page for your Azure AI Search resource, select **Search explorer**.

    ![](../media/Active-image68.png)
   
1. In Search explorer, in the **Query string** box, enter `*` (a single asterisk), and then select **Search**.

    ![](../media/Active-image69.png)

   >**Note**: This query retrieves all documents in the index in JSON format. Examine the results and note the fields for each document, which contain document content, metadata, and enriched data extracted by the cognitive skills you selected.

1. In the **View** menu, select **JSON view**.

   ![](../media/Active-image70.png)

1. Note that the JSON request for the search is shown, like this:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "*"
    }
    ```
   ![](../media/Active-image71.png)
   
1. Modify the JSON request to include the **count** parameter, as shown here:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "*",
      "count": true
    }
    ```

1. Submit the modified search. This time, the results include a **@odata.count** field at the top of the results that indicates the number of documents returned by the search.

1. Try the following query:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "*",
      "count": true,
      "select": "metadata_storage_name,metadata_author,locations"
    }
    ```

    >**Note**: This time, the results include only the file name, author, and any locations mentioned in the document content. The file name and author are in the **metadata_storage_name** and **metadata_author** fields, which were extracted from the source document. The **locations** field was generated by a cognitive skill.

1. Now try the following query string:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "New York",
      "count": true,
      "select": "metadata_storage_name,keyphrases"
    }
    ```

    >**Note**: This search finds documents that mention "New York" in any of the searchable fields and returns the file name and key phrases in the document.

1. Let's try one more query:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "New York",
      "count": true,
      "select": "metadata_storage_name",
      "filter": "metadata_author eq 'Reviewer'"
    }
    ```

    >**Note**: This query returns the filename of any documents authored by *Reviewer* that mention "New York".

      ![](../media/newimg.png) 
  
### Task 6: Explore and modify the definitions of search components

The components of the search solution are based on JSON definitions, which you can view and edit in the Azure portal.

While you can use the portal to create and modify search solutions, it's often desirable to define the search objects in JSON and use the Azure AI Service REST interface to create and modify them.

#### Task 6.1: Get the endpoint and key for your Azure AI Search resource

In this task, you're preparing to execute CURL commands in Visual Studio Code to interact with Azure AI Service's REST interface:

1. In the Azure portal, return to the **Overview** page for your **Azure AI Search** resource, and in the top section of the page, find the **Url** for your resource (which looks like **https://resource_name.search.windows.net**) and copy it to the clipboard.

    ![](../media/Active-image72.png)

1. Expand **Settings**, select **Keys** and copy the **Primary admin key** to the clipboard.

    ![](../media/Active-image74.png)
   
1. In Visual Studio Code, in the Explorer pane, expand the **01-azure-search (1)** folder and its **modify-search (2)** subfolder, and select **modify-search.cmd (3)** to open it. You will use this script file to run *CURL* commands that submit JSON to the Azure AI Service REST interface.

     ![](../media/ai-16.png)
   
1. In **modify-search.cmd**, replace the **YOUR_SEARCH_URL** and **YOUR_ADMIN_KEY** placeholder with the URL and the key you copied to the clipboard and save the changes.

     ![](../media/ai-17.png)

    >**Note**: Don't run it yet!
   
#### Task 6.2: Review and modify the skillset

In this task, you will be configuring a skillset (skillset.json) in Visual Studio Code to integrate Azure AI Services with Azure AI Search:

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **modify-search** folder, open **skillset.json**. This shows a JSON definition for **margies-skillset**.

      ![](../media/ai-18.png)
   
1. At the top of the skillset definition, note the **cognitiveServices** object, which is used to connect your Azure AI Services resource to the skillset.

1. In the Azure portal, search for Azure AI Services resource (<u>not</u> your Azure AI Search resource!)

      ![](../media/newaiservice.png)

1. From the left navigate to Azure AI **Multi-Service-Account** and select the **challengeservice**.

      ![](../media/newaiservice1.png)

1. On **Azure AI Multi-Services-Account** overview page, from the left navigation pane expand **Resource Management** select **Keys and Endpoints**. Then copy **Key 1** to the clipboard.

    ![](../media/Active-image79.png)
   
1. In Visual Studio Code, in **skillset.json**, replace the **YOUR_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_KEY** placeholder with the Azure AI Services key you copied to the clipboard.

   ![](../media/ai-19.png)
   
1. Scroll through the JSON file, noting that it includes definitions for the skills you created using the Azure AI Search user interface in the Azure portal. At the bottom of the list of skills, an additional skill has been added with the following definition:

    ```
      {
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.SentimentSkill",
        "name": "get-sentiment",
        "description": "New skill to evaluate sentiment",
        "context": "/document",
        "defaultLanguageCode": "en",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "text",
            "source": "/document/merged_content"
          },
          {
            "name": "languageCode",
            "source": "/document/language"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [
          {
            "name": "sentiment",
            "targetName": "sentimentLabel"
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

   >**Note**: The new skill is named **get-sentiment**, and for each **document** level in a document, it will evaluate the text found in the **merged_content** field of the document being indexed (which includes the source content as well as any text extracted from images in the content). It uses the extracted **language** of the document (with a default of English) and evaluates a label for the sentiment of the content. Values for the sentiment label can be "positive", "negative", "neutral", or "mixed". This label is then output as a new field named **sentimentLabel**.

1. Save the changes you've made to **skillset.json**.

#### Task 6.3 : Review and modify the index

In this task, you will review the modify-index.json file in Visual Studio Code which shows a JSON definition for **margies-index**

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **modify-search (1)** folder, open **index.json (2)**. This shows a JSON definition for **margies-index**.

     ![](../media/ai-20.png)
   
1. Scroll through the index and view the field definitions. Some fields are based on metadata and content in the source document, and others are the results of skills in the skillset.
1. At the end of the list of fields that you defined in the Azure portal, note that two additional fields have been added:

    ```
    {
        "name": "sentiment",
        "type": "Edm.String",
        "facetable": false,
        "filterable": true,
        "retrievable": true,
        "sortable": true
    },
    {
        "name": "url",
        "type": "Edm.String",
        "facetable": false,
        "filterable": true,
        "retrievable": true,
        "searchable": false,
        "sortable": false
    }
    ```

1. The **sentiment** field will be used to add the output from the **get-sentiment** skill that was added to the skillset. The **url** field will be used to add the URL for each indexed document to the index, based on the **metadata_storage_path** value extracted from the data source. Note that the index already includes the **metadata_storage_path** field, but it's used as the index key and Base-64 encoded, making it efficient as a key but requiring client applications to decode it if they want to use the actual URL value as a field. Adding a second field for the unencoded value resolves this problem.

#### Task 6.4: Review and modify the indexer

In this task, you will review the **indexer.json** file in Visual Studio Code which shows a JSON definition for **margies-indexer**

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **modify-search (1)** folder, open **indexer.json (2)**. This shows a JSON definition for **margies-indexer**, which maps fields extracted from document content and metadata (in the **fieldMappings** section) and values extracted by skills in the skillset (in the **outputFieldMappings** section) to fields in the index.

     ![](../media/ai-21.png)
    
1. In the **fieldMappings** list, note the mapping for the **metadata_storage_path** value to the base-64 encoded key field. This was created when you assigned the **metadata_storage_path** as the key and selected the option to encode the key in the Azure portal. Additionally, a new mapping explicitly maps the same value to the **url** field, but without the Base-64 encoding:

    ```
    {
        "sourceFieldName" : "metadata_storage_path",
        "targetFieldName" : "url"
    }
    
    ```

    > **Note**: All of the other metadata and content fields in the source document are implicitly mapped to fields of the same name in the index.

1. Review the **ouputFieldMappings** section, which maps outputs from the skills in the skillset to index fields. Most of these reflect the choices you made in the user interface, but the following mapping has been added to map the **sentimentLabel** value extracted by your sentiment skill to the **sentiment** field you added to the index:

    ```
    {
        "sourceFieldName": "/document/sentimentLabel",
        "targetFieldName": "sentiment"
    }
    ```

#### Task 6.5 : Use the REST API to update the search solution

In this task, you will update JSON definitions in Visual Studio Code for Azure AI Search to include new fields like sentiment analysis results and document URLs. Run modify-search.cmd to apply changes and start indexing. Monitor progress in Azure portal's Indexers section for completion and document size warnings during sentiment analysis.

1. Right-click the **modify-search** folder and select **open an integrated terminal**.

     ![](../media/ai-25.png)
   
1. In the terminal pane for the **modify-search** folder, enter the following command to run the **modify-search.cmd** script, which submits the JSON definitions to the REST interface and initiates the indexing.

    ```
    .\modify-search
    ```

1. When the script has finished, return to the **Overview** page for your **Azure AI Search** from the left navigation pane expand **Search management** and select **Indexers**. Then periodically select **Refresh** to track the progress of the indexing operation. It may take a minute or so to complete.

   ![](../media/Active-image84.png)

    >**Note**: There may be some warnings for a few documents that are too large to evaluate sentiment. Often, sentiment analysis is performed at the page or sentence level rather than the full document, but in this scenario, most of the documents, particularly the hotel reviews, are short enough for useful document-level sentiment scores to be evaluated.

#### Task 6.6 : Query the modified index
In this task, you'll perform a query in Azure AI Search to retrieve URLs, sentiment, and key phrases for documents mentioning "London" with positive sentiment, authored by "Reviewer".

1. At the top of the overview blade for your Azure AI Search resource, select **Search explorer**.
1. In Search explorer, in the **Query string** box, submit the following JSON query:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "London",
      "select": "url,sentiment,keyphrases",
      "filter": "metadata_author eq 'Reviewer' and sentiment eq 'positive'"
    }
    ```

   ![](../media/newaiservice2.png)

    This query retrieves the **url**, **sentiment**, and **keyphrases** for all documents that mention *London* authored by *Reviewer* that has a positive **sentiment** label (in other words, positive reviews that mention London).

1. Close the **Search explorer** page to return to the **Overview** page.

### Task 7: Create a search client application

Now that you have a useful index, you can use it from a client application. You can do this by consuming the REST interface, submitting requests, and receiving responses in JSON format over HTTP, or you can use the software development kit (SDK) for your preferred programming language. In this exercise, we'll use the SDK.

> **Note**: You can choose to use the SDK for either **C#** or **Python**. In the steps below, perform the actions appropriate for your preferred language.

#### Task 7.1 : Get the endpoint and keys for your search resource

In this task, you'll retrieve the endpoint URL and keys for your Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal, essential for managing and querying your search resources in upcoming tasks.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to **Azure AI Search**. On the Overview page for the **Azure AI Search** resource, note the url value, which should be similar to **https://your_resource_name.search.windows.net**. Please record this value in Notepad as it will be required in upcoming tasks.

    ![](../media/Active-image86.png)
   
1. From the left navigation expand **Settings** select **Keys**, note that there are two **admin** keys and a single **Manage query keys** key.

   >**Note**: An *admin* key is used to create and manage search resources
   >**Note**: An *Manage query keys* key is used by client applications that only need to perform search queries.

    ![](../media/Active-image87.png)

1.  Please copy the **Manage query keys** to the clipboard and record it in Notepad, as it will be needed for upcoming tasks.

     ![](../media/Active-image88.png)
    
#### Task 7.2 : Prepare to use the Azure AI Search SDK

In this task, you'll prepare your development environment in Visual Studio Code to integrate with Azure AI Search SDK by installing the necessary packages (Azure.Search.Documents for C# or azure-search-documents for Python) and configuring endpoint URL and query key in the respective configuration files.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **01-azure-search** folder and expand the **C-Sharp** or **Python** folder depending on your language preference.
1. Right-click the **margies-travel** folder and open an integrated terminal. Then install the Azure AI Search SDK package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:
   > **Note**: Please ensure the necessary extensions are already installed in the VS Code.

    **C#**
    
    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.Search.Documents --version 11.1.1
    ```
    **Python**
    
    ```
    pip install azure-search-documents==11.0.0
    ```
    
1. View the contents of the **margies-travel** folder, and note that it contains a file for configuration settings:
    - **C#**: appsettings.json
    - **Python**: .env

1. Open the configuration file and update the **YOUR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT**  with the **Azure AI Search** *Endpoint URL* link and  **YOUR_SEARCH_QUERY_KEY** values with **Manage query keys** which you recorded in previous tasks and save the changes.

    - **C#**: appsettings.json

       ![](../media/ai-22.png)

    - **Python**: .env
  
      ![](../media/ai-23.png)

#### Task 7.3 : Explore code to search an index

In this task, you'll explore the code for a web application (C# ASP.NET Razor or Python Flask) within the margies-travel folder. You'll review how it interacts with Azure AI Search SDK to perform search queries, configure search clients, and manage search results, including filtering, sorting, and highlighting content fields.

The **margies-travel** folder contains code files for a web application (a Microsoft C# *ASP.NET Razor* web application or a Python *Flask* application), which includes search functionality.

1. Open the following code file in the web application, depending on your choice of programming language:
    - **C#**:Pages/Index.cshtml.cs
    - **Python**: app.py

1. Near the top of the code file, find the comment **Import search namespaces**, and note the namespaces that have been imported to work with the Azure AI Search SDK:

1. In the **search_query** function, find the comment **Create a search client**, and note that the code creates a **SearchClient** object using the endpoint and query key for your Azure AI Search resource:
   
1. In the **search_query** function, find the comment **Submit search query** and review the code to submit a search for the specified text with the following options:
    - A *search mode* that requires **all** of the individual words in the search text to be found.
    - The total number of documents found by the search is included in the results.
    - The results are filtered to include only documents that match the provided filter expression.
    - The results are sorted into the specified sort order.
    - Each discrete value of the **metadata_author** field is returned as a *facet* that can be used to display pre-defined values for filtering.
    - Up to three extracts of the **merged_content** and **imageCaption** fields with the search terms highlighted are included in the results.
    - The results include only the fields specified.

#### Task 7.4 : Explore code to render search results

In this task, you'll delve into the web application's code (either C# ASP.NET Razor or Python Flask) to understand how it presents search results:

The web app already includes code to process and render the search results.

1. Open the following code file in the web application, depending on your choice of programming language:
    - **C#**:Pages/Index.cshtml
    - **Python**: templates/search.html
1. Examine the code, which renders the page on which the search results are displayed. Observe that:
    - The page begins with a search form that the user can use to submit a new search (in the Python version of the application, this form is defined in the **base.html** template), which is referenced at the beginning of the page.
    - A second form is then rendered, enabling the user to refine the search results. The code for this form:
        - Retrieves and displays the count of documents from the search results.
        - Retrieves the facet values for the **metadata_author** field and displays them as an option list for filtering.
        - Creates a drop-down list of sort options for the results.
    - The code then iterates through the search results, rendering each result as follows:
        - Display the **metadata_storage_name** (file name) field as a link to the address in the **url** field.
        - Displaying *highlights* for search terms found in the **merged_content** and **imageCaption** fields to help show the search terms in context.
        - Display the **metadata_author**, **metadata_storage_size**, **metadata_storage_last_modified**, and **language** fields.
        - Display the **sentiment** label for the document. Can be positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.
        - Display the first five **keyphrases** (if any).
        - Display the first five **locations** (if any).
        - Display the first five **imageTags** (if any).

#### Task 7.5 : Run the web app

In this task, you'll be running the Margie's Travel web application locally, searching for specific terms like "London hotel" and "quiet hotel in New York", refining search results using filters and sorting options based on sentiment, observing keyword and location identification in documents.


 1. Return to the integrated terminal for the **margies-travel** folder and enter the following command to run the program:
    
    **C#**
    
    ```
    dotnet run
    ```
    > **Note:** If the command fails, click on the provided link in the error message to download the latest version of the Microsoft ASP.NET Core Shared Framework. After that, download and install .NET Core, and then run the command again.
        
    **Python**
     
    ```
    pip install flask
    flask run
    ```
    > **Note:** If the command fails, **run pip Install python-dotenv** command and then run the command again.

1. Open the another tab in edge browse following the link (*http://localhost:5000/* or *http://127.0.0.1:5000/*) to open the **Margie's Travel** site in a web browser.

    ![](../media/Active-image101.png)
   
1. On the **Margie's Travel** website, enter **London hotel (1)** into the search box and click **Search (2)**.

    ![](../media/Active-image95.png)
   
1. Review the search results. They include the file name (with a hyperlink to the file URL), an extract of the file content with the search terms (*London* and *hotel*) emphasized, and other attributes of the file from the index fields.

    ![](../media/Active-image96.png)
   
1. Observe that the results page includes some user interface elements that enable you to refine the results. These include:
    
    - A *Filter by author* based on a facet value for the **metadata_author** field. This demonstrates how you can use *facetable* fields to return a list of *facets* - fields with a small set of discrete values that can be displayed as potential filter values in the user interface.
    
    - A **Sort by** ability to *order* the results based on a specified field and sort direction (ascending or descending). The default order is based on *relevancy*, which is calculated as a **search.score()** value based on  a *scoring profile* that evaluates the frequency and importance of search terms in the index fields.

1. Select the **Reviewer** filter and the **Positive to negative** sort option, and then select **Refine Results**.

    ![](../media/Active-image97.png)
   
1. Observe that the results are filtered to include only reviews and sorted based on the sentiment label.
   
    ![](../media/Active-image98.png)
   
1. On the **Margie's Travel** website, enter **quiet hotel in New York (1)** into the search box and click **Search (2)**.

    ![](../media/Active-image99.png)
   
1. Try the following search terms:
    - **Tower of London** (observe that this term is identified as a *key phrase* in some documents).
    - **skyscraper** (observe that this word doesn't appear in the actual content of any documents but is found in the *image captions* and *image tags* that were generated for images in some documents).
    - **Mojave desert** (observe that this term is identified as a *location* in some documents).

1. Close the browser tab containing Margie's Travel website and return to Visual Studio Code. Then, in the Python terminal for the **margies-travel** folder (where the dotnet or flask application is running), enter Ctrl+C to stop the app.
